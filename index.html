        <div class="subheading mb-5">Events Committee Member at Undergraduate Business Association</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"></p>Hello! My name is Jon Bryan and I am currently a first year Business Administration Student at the University of California, Riverside. In the future, I plan on double majoring in Art Studio in order to help me achieve my dream of becoming an Imagineer for Walt Disney Imagineering, designing theme park lands for the Walt Disney Company. Besides my interest in the creative field, I am interested in concentrating in marketing in the School of Business. In order to sell myself, here are a few quick things about me and what experience I have!<br><br>

        I currently am an active member in the Undergraduate Business Association of UCR, working in the newly established events committee. Under this committee we were able to organize and market our Winter Quarter event titled "Meet Your Concentration," featuring a panel of professors and alumni from the School of Business to speak about the different concentrations available at UCR. The high success of this event is attributed to multiple connections with the leaders of business clubs on-campus and the business ambassadors of the School of Business. In the Spring Quarter, the events committee will host another large event featuring another business organization on campus, the Association of Latino Professionals For America. In the end, my experience working in a group setting to plan these events have helped me become a more effective communicator and collaborative worker while advancing my position on campus! <br><br>

        Besides my involvement in business organizations at UCR during my free time, I love to do art. I currently attend the weekly meetings for Starving Artists of UCR to network myself with other similar minded artists on campus and learn more from their experiences with art. Through this club, I have gained new techniques when it comes to still and life drawing with the help of fellow members and the leader of organizations. I did also take part in the gallery presentation where I showcase my artwork to all the students involved in the club. Apart from my involvement with Starving Artists, I do work with multiple mediums from painting with acrylics and oils to digital art on my laptop and iPad, but I do prefer digital art more. With a future double major in Art Studio, I do plan on applying my artistic skills in the graphic design section of marketing. It is important to create something iconic and lasting in someone's mind in order to gain the competitive advantage. One way I have done this is designing a PowerPoint presentation for the "Meet Your Concentration" event. From using minimalistic and contemporary symbols to a custom designed PowerPoint theme, I helped maintain a sense of professionalism in the event. Aside from using my graphical design skills, I currently started a small business called Inkling Art to help market myself to those interested in my work. With this self-owned business, I plan on expanding my art commissions and eventually selling merchandise from stickers, clothing, and even pillowcases! In the end, with the art and business skills I have I am ready to connect with the hearts and minds of all people.
